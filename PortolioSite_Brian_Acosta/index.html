    Commented code is useless when you go live as it brings nothing for the user but it's downloaded anyway (same apllies 
    for CSS). THis is no big deal when you have a single portfolio page but if you work on a corporate site this can mean in a 
    month several useless provided and download MB

      If you have your images prepared in advanced and the original dimensions of it are the ones that would be rendered
      in the browser (i.e. you won't be applying and & rule to it) you can set the width and height in the html in order
      to make the browser know in advance the size of it so it can prepare the layout as image loading is asynchronous
